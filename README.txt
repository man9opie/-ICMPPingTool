In order to run my program for part B, you may need to uncomment the first line in main,
which is my path for my own test. 

The logic of this program is that first take a pacp file and look for its first ARP request packet
by searching packets and check is a ARP packet or not. After we find the first ARP request packet
and print all the information of that packet, we look for the first the first ARP respond packet 
and print it out and quit.
